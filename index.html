<p>The Stacks library comes with a set of built-in, general purpose stacks that are great for creating a page layout, but if you're familiar with Mac OS X, HTML and CSS you can create your own stacks to add to the Stacks library.</p>

<p>This document describes how to build your own stacks and gives a reference to the available options in the API.</p>

<p>There's an active community of stack developers that discuss how to build and market stacks in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/stack_developers">this Google group</a>.  If you have questions, it's a good place to ask.</p>

<a id="what-is-a-stack" class="anchor" href="#what-is-a-stack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is a stack</h4>

<p>A stack is one element in a Stacks layout.  Any item that can be added to a Stacks layout comes from the library.  Each item in the library is a stack. An outside container (usually two divs) that Stacks provides and the inner content of the stack, which comes from stack's bundle. The bundle of each stack has a number of files which specify the custom properties, the HTML/CSS/JS/PHP content, and any other file assets the stack needs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Note: In this document we will use the term *</em>Stacks** (capitalized and plural) to refer to the plugin. We will use the term <strong>stack</strong> (lowercase and singular) to refer to the layout elements that you create with the Stacks API.*</p>

<a id="where-do-stacks-get-installed" class="anchor" href="#where-do-stacks-get-installed" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where do Stacks get installed</h4>

<p>Each default stack resides inside of the Stacks plugin bundle.  You can view them (but you should not modify them) by right-clicking on the Stacks.rwplugin file and choosing <strong>Show Package Contents</strong>. To install your own stacks into you should add them to the Stacks folder.  </p>

<p>The Stacks folder can be found in: <code>~/Library/Application Support/RapidWeaver/Stacks</code></p>

<p>If this folder doesn't yet exist, it will be created the first time you use Stacks.</p>

<h4>
<a id="working-with-bundles" class="anchor" href="#working-with-bundles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Working with bundles</h4>

<p>On Mac OS X, a bundle is a folder with a file extension that <em>belongs</em> to an application.  These folders appear as a single file to the user.  Double clicking them launches the owning app rather than opening the folder.  RapidWeaver has graciously done this for folders with the <code>.stack</code> extension.  So if you have RapidWeaver installed any stack you create should immediately gain the stack icon and open RapidWeaver when double-clicked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: <strong>RapidWeaver will install a double-clicked stack into the Stacks folder.</strong></p>

<h4>
<a id="whats-inside-a-stack" class="anchor" href="#whats-inside-a-stack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's inside a stack</h4>

<p>A stack is built as a standard Mac OS X bundle.  This means that it's a folder with a very specific structure.  Inside the folder you'll find a Contents folder and inside of that you'll find the property list and the stack's resources.  You can use this reference to build your own from scratch, but it's probably easier to start from a copy of one of the built-in stacks.</p>
