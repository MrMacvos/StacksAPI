A popup menu for selecting a single item from a short list. 
Popup menus are a good way to choose from a short list of items. If there are only two items in the list a checkbox is probably more appropriate. If the list of items is long (more than 15 or so) then it may be more appropriate to just ask the user to type in the value in a Text Input field.
