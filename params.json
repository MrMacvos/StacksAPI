If you have questions, it's a good place to ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contents\r\n\r\n  * [What is a stack][]\r\n  * [Where do Stacks get installed][]\r\n  * [Working with bundles][]\r\n  * [What's inside a stack][]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[What is a stack]: #Whatisastack\r\n<a name='Whatisastack'></a>\r\n####What is a stack\r\nA stack is one element in a Stacks layout.  Any item that can be added to a Stacks layout comes from the library.  Each item in the library is a stack. An outside container (usually two divs) that Stacks provides and the inner content of the stack, which comes from stack's bundle. The bundle of each stack has a number of files which specify the custom properties, the HTML/CSS/JS/PHP content, and any other file assets the stack needs.\r\n\r\n> *Note: In this document we will use the term **Stacks** (capitalized and plural) to refer to the plugin. We will use the term **stack** (lowercase and singular) to refer to the layout elements that you create with the Stacks API.*\r\n\r\n\r\n[Where do Stacks get installed]: #WheredoStacksgetinstalled\r\n<a name='WheredoStacksgetinstalled'></a>\r\n####Where do Stacks get installed\r\nEach default stack resides inside of the Stacks plugin bundle.  You can view them (but you should not modify them) by right-clicking on the Stacks.rwplugin file and choosing **Show Package Contents**. To install your own stacks into you should add them to the Stacks folder.  \r\n\r\nThe Stacks folder can be found in: `~/Library/Application Support/RapidWeaver/Stacks`\r\n\r\nIf this folder doesn't yet exist, it will be created the first time you use Stacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Working with bundles]: #Workingwithbundles\r\n<a name='Workingwithbundles'></a>\r\n####Working with bundles\r\nOn Mac OS X, a bundle is a folder with a file extension that *belongs* to an application.  These folders appear as a single file to the user.  Double clicking them launches the owning app rather than opening the folder.  RapidWeaver has graciously done this for folders with the `.stack` extension.  So if you have RapidWeaver installed any stack you create should immediately gain the stack icon and open RapidWeaver when double-clicked.\r\n\r\n> Note: **RapidWeaver will install a double-clicked stack into the Stacks folder.**\r\n\r\n[What's inside a stack]: #Whatsinsideastack\r\n<a name='Whatsinsideastack'></a>\r\n####What's inside a stack\r\nA stack is built as a standard Mac OS X bundle.  This means that it's a folder with a very specific structure.  Inside the folder you'll find a Contents folder and inside of that you'll find the property list and the stack's resources.  You can use this reference to build your own from scratch, but it's probably easier to start from a copy of one of the built-in stacks.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
